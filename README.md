DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK : Task 3: AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
This Python code creates a chatbot that answers questions related to Python programming. Using the NLTK library, the chatbot responds to various queries about Python basics, such as how to install Python, define variables, work with data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries), handle errors, and understand object-oriented programming (OOP). The bot is interactive and continuously responds until the user types 'exit'. This code demonstrates basic NLP techniques, including pattern matching and responses relevant to Python programming.
